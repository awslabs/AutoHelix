# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-02

### Added

- KernelBench GPU optimization scaffolding for all 270 upstream tasks, including
  a CUDA evaluation harness and container configuration.
- A five-iteration KernelBench aggregate: 3.12× median best-so-far speedup with
  Claude Opus 4.8 on an H200.
- The per-task aggregate and plot source behind the 154-task AlgoTune result.
- Advanced loop examples for research, implementation task queues, AI workflow
  optimization, and nested AutoHelix runs.
- CI coverage for Python 3.11 and 3.12, plus tests and wheel verification in the
  gated PyPI publishing workflow.

### Fixed

- Preserve and scope-check changes when an agent creates commits inside its
  iteration worktree.
- Fail closed when an agent reports an infrastructure error, without merging
  changes or consuming the iteration number.
- Handle Codex `turn.failed` events and valid non-object JSON output.
- Reject baselines that omit configured metrics.
- Kill constraint and metric subprocess groups when a run is interrupted.

### Changed

- Removed the older bin-packing and budget-demo examples in favor of examples
  organized around reusable loop patterns.
